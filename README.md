3. Save the images, which you want to use in your document, in the folder images.

All Markdown files in that folder are going to be compiled. In the output file the chapters have the same order like the order of the markdown files in the folder.
5. To compile your Markdown document into a pdf: **Double click on run.sh**
6. The pdf file is stored in the folder output.
